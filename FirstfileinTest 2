Hello,
But There is nothing in this file.
Well, nothing is something.
Zero is not nothing, but nothing can be represented by zero.

What to do about Roman numbers? Do they have a zero?


No, they don't have a zero.
This web site talks about it.

We can ask the same thing about the Mayan number systems.
Here are some details .

I rather not talk about this topic, its very personal to me.

Ciao,
