We can ask the same thing about the Mayan number systems
here are some details 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_numerals

There are a couple probable reasons for these two groups of people not having a specific notation or concept of "zero" 
Well fist of all zero is probably the most complicated "number"
It's complicated because it doesen't act like other numbers
It bends and twists the rules that we have created for the other numbers
If zero is the embodyment of nothing how do we count it
We only go off of a concept of zero in our modern day 
We still don't know the true meaning behind this symbol
Maybe we will never learn the truth behind it either
That's it for my thoughts today
bye
